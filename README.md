# javascript-challenge
An extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest. The challenge is to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values.

Competencies: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js
